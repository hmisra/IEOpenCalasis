the pair went out for pizza, which was the first time pat ever had pizza. with a desire to establish a life together, pat and jerry were married on june 19, 1954, at the local presbyterian church in schoolcraft. after a reception in her parents dairy barn, the newlyweds were off to a honeymoon in kentucky with $100 in their pocket! watching pat and jerry was like watching an episode of i love lucy since they both had an amazing sense of humor. together pat and jerry were blessed to become parents of three wonderful girls, belinda, christy, and kara. although she had been working at shakespeare in kalamazoo prior to getting married, pat was able to stay home to raise their girls. she did work doing odds and ends to save money for the holidays. much later in life, pat and jerry ran a bar together. she was an active part of her girls lives including as their softball coach for years. it was quite a sight to see pat doing their exercises with a cigarette in her mouth! although they worked hard, they played hard, too. some of their favorite memories were made frogging at bankson lake as well as snowmobiling in the winter. throughout her life pat was a woman of many interests and a bustle of activity. she and jerry have been called the socialites of schoolcraft since they had something going on every night. when they were home, they could often be found in a competitive game of battleship with drinks in hand. pat loved golf whether she was playing on several golf leagues or watching, and for years she frequented shamrock and jeptha golf course, especially during her retirement years. tiger woods and greg norman were her favorites. additionally, pat played tennis. since she was raised on a farm she was never interested in pets until later in life when she kind of had no choice since they seemed to gravitate to her! pat was amazing at decorating her home, and when it came to cooking, most of it was done in a casserole or crock pot. pizza, thin and crispy, was her favorite food, and everything was great with a cheap beer of some kind like busch lite. pat looked forward to the holidays every year, and since she worked to bring in some extra money she was known to shower her girls with presents. as someone who loved decorating, she began planning her holiday decorations in june! pat was a fan of terry bradshaw and the steelers as well as the lions. she liked sinatra and andy williams as well as oldies from people like patsy cline. stardust was pat and jerrys song. for 15 years, pat was on oxygen, and she battled emphysema for more than 10 years. a longtime smoker, she would have smoked up until her last day if they would have let her. pat always loved being a grandmother, and more recently a great-grandmother as well. funny, colorful, and unique in her own way, patricia mc. intyre was a blessing to everyone she met. she could be opinionated at times, and it has also been said that if she wasnt happy then no one was happy. pat was the sort of person who didnt much care what others thought, and there was nothing she treasured more than her family. she will never be forgotten. patricia l. mc. intyre, of bloomingdale, died on june 10, 2015 at her home. members of her family include 3 daughters: belinda (thorne) angell; christy (robert) piper and kara tomerlin; 5 grandchildren: jill angell (alisha krcatovich), conrad (erika) angell, mollie (marco) baldenegro, john bucky (dr. kristin) piper, and tramble (kimberlee) tomerlin; 4 great-grandchildren: madison, ryan, carter and mia; 2 brothers: riley (marney) wyant and john (linda) wyant; and many nieces and nephews. pat was preceded in death by her husband, gerald mc. intyre, in 2013. services will be held friday 11:00 a. m. at the life story funeral home, betzler & thompson, 60900 m-40, paw paw; 657-3870 with visitation starting at 10:00 a. m. a luncheon will follow at jeptha golf course. private burial will take place at ft. custer national cemetery. please visit pats personal web page at www. lifestorynet. com, where you can archive a favorite memory or photo and sign her online guestbook before coming to the funeral home. memorial donations may be made to the first congregational church of grand junction. privacy policy & terms2015 life. storynet, llc<div id='no-js-cntr'><input id='i-close-no-js-4048' name='n-close-no-js-4048' type='checkbox' /><div id='no-js'><p>java. script is disabled. in order to use all of the features on www. lifestorynet. com, <a href='https://www. google. com/support/bin/answer. py? answer=23852' target='_blank' >enable java. script</a>.<label class='btn' for='i-close-no-js-4048'>close</label></p></div></div> home. locationslife story experience. about us. servicescremation & burial. testimonialsfacebook & obituaries. funeral homes
