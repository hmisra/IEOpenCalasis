| bonnie clare wilmot clayton1922-2015 bonnie clare wilmot clayton died at her home, june 11, 2015. she wrote the following obituary. if you are reading this, you can be sure i died. not too surprising since i was born on oct. 7 1922. that is a lot of years. i was born in walla walla, wa to helen jones and ralph l. wilmot, an incompatible pair who divorced in 1936. i was raised in ogden, attended st. joseph catholic school, weber high school, and a year at weber college before marrying the love of my life, emmett h. clayton in 1941. emmett died in 1994. we have four superb children all beautiful, talented and charming: dennis (summer) clayton, port orange, florida, kathleen (paul) zenisek, littleton, colorado, sidney clayton, bountiful, utah, scott (rhonda) clayton, sandy, utah. there are eight terrific grandchildren: richard bartz, michael bartz, kristin clayton, jennifer master, david zenisek, christopher zenisek, nick clayton, and maxwell chase clayton. and there are 22 charming great and great-great grandchildren. after raising my children, i returned to weber college in 1957 and found i could compete with the younger generation, earned an associate degree in nursing and was a practicing registered nurse at thomas d. dee memorial hospital. having gained momentum, i earned the bs in nursing at the university of utah in 1961 and, after moving to bountiful, completed the ms in psychiatric nursing in 1964. i was honored to study and teach in the graduate program in psychosocial nursing at the college of nursing, earned a ph. d. in education in 1976 and retired in 1987. the many personal and professional relationships have been cherished beyond calculation, particularly my association with students, faculty, and staff of the university of utah college of nursing. my modest ventures as an artist were a notable outlet -- ranging from some pretty good watercolors to some really good portraits, including the academic portrait of my friend, dean mildred r. quinn of the university of utah college of nursing. any regrets? sure. there are a thousand books left unread and a million words of encouragement and love left unspoken. but i survived four primary cancers, thanks to the incredible physicians and a supportive family. so please, no tears and no funeral. cheers! dr. clayton is survived by her children and their progenies, her sisters-in-law jolene clayton and joan mc. gregor. she is also survived by her many nieces and nephews, including guy freeland, christine kyriopoulos and john turner. in lieu of flowers, the family suggests contributions to the university of utah college of nursing or the huntsman cancer institute at the university of utah. to paraphrase diane, one of bonnies many favorite students: we are forever grateful to bonnie for the wisdom and peace and beauty she brought to our lives. care entrusted to lindquists bountiful mortuary. condolences may be shared at www. lindquistmortuary. com
