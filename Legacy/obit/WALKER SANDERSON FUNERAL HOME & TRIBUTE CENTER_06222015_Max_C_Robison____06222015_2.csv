magna, utah, the second of four children: dick, max, connie and jim. max married joan roberts on august 18, 1950. after graduation from byu, max and joan started a life that led them to alameda county, california, where they raised six children: nancy, allen, cheri, cindy, chris, and aaron. those years included many adventures including unique family cars, a family-run ice cream parlor, weekend trips to the cabin with waterskiing, sailboats, and a wonderful christ-centered family life filled with lds church activities. we are an eternal family. with fond memories of growing up in magna, max recalls shooting wooden guns with rubber bands, sleigh riding from the top of his street, learning to ice skate, bon fires, night games and playing in the magna hills. main street, especially at christmas time, seemed a magical place. max was a musician and received an accordion for christmas while in grade school. he learned how to play it that very day. he's been playing the accordion ever since performing at city celebrations, local restaurants, senior centers and for his family. he joined the american legion drum corp in junior high. he also played the organ, marimba, drums, the spoons and any percussion instrument he could dream up. he played the drums in a traveling dance band while serving an lds mission in the southern states. max entered the navy right after high school. while his time in the service does not hold a lot of pleasant memories, he received amphibious training while at the naval station in san diego, and learned to drive landing craft boats starting his lifelong interest in riding on the water. after completing naval service max was accepted to byu where he would later graduate with a degree in social work, and complete to a 33-year career in alameda county's welfare department as a social worker. max knew joan roberts in high school, and fell madly in love on his first date. they started to date just a few weeks before leaving on his mission and they were married after his return. max finished his degree at byu and shortly thereafter, nancy was born. they lived and worked in the salt lake valley for another two years until allen was also part of the family. that's when they headed to california to start a new chapter in their life. four more children would join the family cheri, cindy, chris and aaron. by the time aaron joined the family, the house in hayward was bursting at the seams. an addition was built-on to the home including a family room big enough to house many a ping-pong tournament, as well as two bedrooms and a bathroom for the upstairs. entrepreneurial inclinations led to adventures including the lollipop palace a family run ice cream parlor and sandwich shop where joan ran the kitchen and all six children pitched in. max had a thriving worm farm that met an untimely demise during a drought. boats held a special fascination for max. over the years he owned several different motor boats, two different sail boats, and even built his own kayak from a kit. waterskiing and sailing were treasured weekend activities. church activities were the center of family life. max served over 20 years as a bishop's counselor, and 13 years as an early morning seminary teacher. one of his favorite callings in later life was serving in the baptistery at the provo temple. favorite activities for max and joan later in life included square-dancing, traveling with friends to tropical locations, and visiting grandchildren. max had a personal credo: my greatest accomplishment was going after what i wanted even though everybody said i couldn't do it. i had to work hard and face rejection time after time. i got what i wanted and what i deserved. max has 6 children with 5 children-in-law, 24 grandchildren and 29+3 great-grandchildren. as a family, we take comfort in knowing max is smiling, chewing bubblegum and jumping on a pogo stick. viewing is from 6-8 pm on sunday, june 21, 2015, at the lds chapel located at 865 w 1000 n, orem, utah, 84057. funeral services are monday, june 22, 2015, at the same location with a viewing at 9 am and funeral at 10 am. read max robison's obituary and guestbook on
