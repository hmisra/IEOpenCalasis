1955, then there was william elijah morgan 1902 - 1974, and her sister, five years older than she, was pauline bell morgan (sullwold) 1912 - 2003. lucile was the youngest of the 14 morgan cousins whose parents, including her father, traveled from kentucky to missouri by covered wagon. she was the last of her generation of morgans. she was very proud of her frontier roots, her pioneer father and his parents and siblings and her mother, who grew up in a sod house. lucile's family lived on the farm until she was three, then they moved to the city, st joseph, mo, where her two, much older brothers worked. at six years of age, her parents and the girls returned to the farm until her father passed away when she was twelve-years-old. her mother sold off the farm and nearly all their possessions and moved lucile and her older sister pauline back to the city where her mother ran a boarding home. lucile was deeply influenced by her participation in the y-girls of the ywca and her membership with the first baptist church of st. joseph, mo and the bypua, baptist young people's union of america. the family moved many times, so the girls went to many different schools, but lucile spent her high school years at central high school in st. joseph, mo. she was active in sports and particularly fond of working in the school library, at one time entertaining the idea of becoming a librarian. she graduated in 1936 and went to work at kennedy's department store in st. joseph, mo, where she met another central alum who graduated the year before. while she hadn't known this nice fellow while in school, he had asked her to sign his wakitan year book long before he knew she would be the love of his life. lucile married wilmur allen 'ed/eddie' edson, december 4, 1937 in her mother's home. wilmur became a window dresser, and his work caused them to move to locations in missouri and kansas before they settled in topeka with their, at the time, two boys, lee allen and dean edward. donald wilmur was born in topeka and still later, came the youngest, linda kay. while her youngest boy was in grade school, lucile went to work in the school lunchroom. she later sold fuller brush products, but she spent the lion's share of her working years with katz drug in topeka that later became skaggs and then osco (now cvs). she retired from osco in 1983. in 2010 she was honored by first baptist church in topeka for her over 50 year membership. her beloved husband, wilmur allen 'eddie' edson, passed away under the care of lucile and their daughter with assistance of heartland hospice workers in their daughters home on father's day, june 16, 2002. she was also preceded in death by her son, dean edward edson on november 9, 2011. lucile is survived by her oldest son, lee allen edson and his wife, joan of overland park, ks, her youngest son, donald wilmur edson and his wife, becky of shawnee, ks, and her youngest child, her daughter, linda (edson) windler and her husband, merle of topeka, ks. she is also survived by eight grandchildren, 23 great grandchildren (the most recent born june 9, 2015) and nieces and nephews. a visitation is planned for 6 pm to 8 pm, friday, june 26, 2015 at the penwell-gabel mid-town chapel, 1321 sw 10th avenue, topeka, ks. lucile wanted her memorial service to include a salute to her ancestors. this celebration of family and friends will be held at 10 am, saturday, june 27, 2015 at the first baptist church, 3033 sw mac. vicar, topeka, ks. a graveside service will follow at penwell-gabel cemetery, 3616 sw 6th avenue, topeka, ks. memorial contributions may be made to first baptist church of topeka or the helping hands humane society, 5720 sw 21st, topeka, ks 66604-3720. to leave a special message for lucile's family, please click the share memories button above.
