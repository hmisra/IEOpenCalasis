 claire g. mc. grath| claire g. mc. grath, 89, of wayne, died peacefully at home on tuesday, june 10, 2015. she had been surrounded by her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren in her final days, a testament to the legacy of love she leaves behind. a native of springfield, massachusetts, claire graduated from cathedral high school with the class of 1943, in the midst of world war ii. she continued her education, earning an associates degree. as her family began to grow, she moved to southfield, michigan, a suburb of detroit. after a few years in michigan, they moved back to springfield and then eventually to wayne where they settled in 1965. as her children grew, she took a position at the jm towne department store. years later she accepted a position at capezio, a job she truly enjoyed. her co-workers treated her like family and she was very proud of the work she did. she loved it so much that she didnt retire until she was almost 80 years old! claire was extremely efficient at running her household; in fact, her own children look back and wonder how she did it all. raising six kids was no easy task, but claire had established routines and kept order like no one else could. she would paint the house perpetually, doing small areas at a time, always keeping the place looking fresh. she was a good cook, too and a great baker. she especially loved working in the kitchen alongside her grandchildren, making cookies and other special treats. she taught her granddaughters the trick to enjoying what they had made: hide everything from the boys before they have a chance to eat it all! claire was a stylish dresser, and had the fully-stocked closet to prove it. wherever she was headed, she always looked sharp and fashionable. her personality was warm and witty; she was always ready with a corny joke (at which she was usually the first to laugh). although she held true to her convictions, occasionally revealing just how stubborn she could be, she maintained a great sense of humor and preferred to keep things light. claire considered being a grandmother one of the highlights of her life. she savored the time she had with her grandchildren and carved out a unique relationship with each and every one of them. this unconditional love was then passed to her great-grandchildrenall 11 of themeven as her health began to fade. claire kept a jar of m&ms close to her bedside, which drew the littlest ones into her room during the past few years. the sweet conversations she had with each candy-seeker led to some very special moments, which were perhaps more precious to her than anything else. each child now has wonderful memories of great-grandma they will cherish for many years. claire is survived by her loving children: mary ellen brady and her husband dan of hatfield, pa; michael mc. grath of denver, co; mark mc. grath and his wife valerie of wayne, nj; william mc. grath and his wife darylann of cincinnati, oh; and patricia stamler and her husband matt of vernon, nj. she is also survived by her brother, paul gallagher, of novato, ca, twelve grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren. she was predeceased by her son matthew mc. grath in 1996, and by her two brothers, james and thomas gallagher. a memorial mass is scheduled for 11 am on saturday, june 27, 2015 at st. marys rc church, pompton avenue, pompton lakes, nj. in lieu of flowers, memorial donations would be greatly appreciated to the packanack lake volunteer fire company 5, 5 lake drive west, wayne, nj 07470.
