wade wride fillmore| for wade wride fillmore written by himself. he was transferred to the world of spirits on 9 june 2015 at the age of 73. 5 years. about two months after the attack by the japanese navy on pearl harbor, i took my first breath of earthly air on the 4th day of february 1942 in a basement house on the corner of 7th east and 4th south in spanish fork, utah. dr. milo c. moody attended my wonderful mother, gwendolyn ethel wride fillmore, in this delivery of her third child. marcia grace (ted beach) and barry lee (jane swift) preceded me. edgar ray (judy lowe), greg lewis (marie clark), bruce lynn (ann soderberg) and maralee (david gardner) followed me. my good father elmer lee fillmore was 35 when i was born and mother was 33. i felt loved in my home. i love my siblings and parents with all my heart. i know and love all of my nieces and nephews. i was surprised at my call to japan as a missionary in february of 1961. elder gordon b. hinckley set me apart as a missionary blessing me that i would learn the japanese language quickly and well and that i would love the people of japan. japanese came to me easily and i delighted in learning to read, write, speak and understand in that language. i learned many things for the first time in japanese. when my mission ended, i wept a long time, even on the plane home. i have lived in japan a total of seven years and have traveled there many times. arriving home, i visited the church financial department in salt lake city as i had been invited in a letter from brother i. ivins bentley. my brother ed was on his mission in germany at the time so our family couldnt support my college education, but i did have faith. i was offered a job at the financial department, decided to enter the university of utah, made arrangements to live with my aunt maudlin close to the university, and saw my wife-to-be, katheryne joanne bailey, all on that day at the financial department. elder boyd k. packer officiated at our sealing in the salt lake temple on december 17, 1964 and because of the goodness and valor of my darling wife, we are privileged to be the parents of brent dwayne (joan woodbury), angela lynne (chad catmull), nancy joanne (taul), rebecca (john osai), lincoln seth (cheryl durrant), and james riley (tara wolf). in order of birth our beloved grandchildren are erin (peter olds), amy (kacy bowen). ryan (rachelle worwood), nathan, jacob, anthony (nathalie morales), malachi, jace, sara, jessica, taylor, daniel, olivia, grace, and nicholas. ester, micah, kyrie, liam and sophie are our delightful great grandchildren with two more on the way. i have had a wonderful life full of learning and joy. i have visited 40 countries and traveled around the world twice. i have met many interesting people and been influenced for good by many hundreds of them. my darling wife for over 50 years, angelic joanne, the light of my life, my eternal companion, patiently and joyfully supported me as we have lived in 25 different locations, three in japan, one in georgia, two in new york city and virginia, four in california, several in utah and finally here in idaho. we served happily together on three senior couple missions, one in the eastern united states and the caribbean and two in japan. i have had wonderful and challenging work experiences which i will not mention. from the time i received my patriarchal blessing in december of 1959, i have continuously followed its council to learn spiritual things. i know in whom i have trusted. our father in heavens love for us moved him to create this earth and design and implement the plan of salvation. his only begotten son in the flesh, jesus christ volunteered to meet the demands of justice and break the bands of death on our behalf so we can be perfected in him and return to the presence of our eternal father as families. i am grateful to know that i have the opportunity to continue my path of repentance in the world of the spirits. i believe i am now needed on another mission in the world of the spirits to assist with the work among those who lived and died in japan, among those who are my relatives, and others. maybe i can be a companion to my father, also. to all those i know and love, i bid a temporary adieu. funeral services will be held on monday at 11 am at the broomhead funeral home, 12600 south 2200 west in riverton, utah with a visitation one hour prior to services. interment in the sandy city cemetery.
