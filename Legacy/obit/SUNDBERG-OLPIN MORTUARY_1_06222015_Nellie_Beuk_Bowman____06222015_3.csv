we have missed them at the temple since they left, but now we can think of them coming to visit occasionally (if they are allowed). we loved maurice and nellie. they were our friends, mentors, examples. i remember once when i asked nellie to come speak to the young women in our ward. she gave an amazing talk about her life, how she joined the church and met and married maurice. he was smiling as he watched her. she looked at him with such love. it makes me so happy to know they are together again for eternity!
