| for dr. wayne edward james wayne james departed his earthly life and was received into eternal rest by the loving arms of his savior on friday, june 19, 2015. he was preceded in death by his parents, garland and addie james; he is survived by his brother, bill james. as wayne transitioned to glory, he was surrounded by his wife, alvonda; his children, lisa, david and his wife sheri, and robert and his wife melissa; his grandsons, brandon and jonathan; and his nurse, tammy. what a wonderful blessing his family received to watch him enter into the arms of our blessed lord! wayne was born in yellville, arkansas, on november 18, 1936, the son of garland and addie james. he spent his childhood school days in several arkansas towns, including yellville, rison, and smackover. after his high school graduation, he received a basketball scholarship from arkansas college in batesville where he met alvonda poorboy and god's plan for their life together began to unfold. the two of them were married on may 29, 1958. after wayne's graduation from arkansas college with a degree in biology and chemistry, he and alvonda moved to fayetteville so that he could work on his masters degree in biological sciences and to pursue a career with the arkansas fish and game commission. however, god continued to work in wayne's and alvonda's lives while they were ministering with pastor ross fite at fayetteville baptist church. when wayne and alvonda took some students from the youth group to church camp at camp sagmount during the summer, they were praying that god would call some of the young people into christian service. while watching the film ""the man who forgot god,"" the song ""i'll go where you want me to go"" was sung, and god touched wayne's and alvonda's hearts to serve him in full-time christian work. seeking god's will and direction, wayne and alvonda enrolled in the missions course at baptist bible college in springfield, missouri. after graduation in 1963, they felt burdened for the closed churches in the new england area. working under the guidance of buddy frankland in eastport, maine, they felt the lord directing them to milltown, new brunswick, canada. there, god enabled them to build a work among the people of milltown, st. stephen, and the surrounding area. evangelist don brown encouraged wayne to begin a radio broadcast to blanket the area with the gospel, and after several months of the radio broadcast, evangelist brown held a revival meeting in st. stephen. milltown baptist church still thrives to this day as a legacy of the mission impact of wayne and alvonda. in time, the lord directed wayne to pacific coast baptist bible college, and the young family moved across the country from new brunswick to pasadena, california, to begin service there. dr. jack baskin was president of the college, and wayne served as the executive assistant to dr. baskin. the lord used both wayne and jack together to spread the gospel across the world through many trips to korea, thailand, cambodia, vietnam, the philippine islands, and other asian countries. their love for missions was apparent, and many baptist churches exist in asia today due to the support and influence of these two chosen men of god. in march of 2006 while ministering at new hope baptist church in bowie, texas, wayne was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. the doctors found it prudent to proceed with radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. the surgery was successful in removing the cancer, but wayne's lungs were heavily scarred due to the radiation and complications brought on by several bouts of pneumonia. even during this, god gave him strength to continue pastoring. in 2008, he felt it necessary to take a temporary rest from ministry in order to seek medical care. yet, the call to the lord's ministry was a burden on wayne's heart, so he and alvonda prayed that the lord would open up another ministry for them. god answered in 2011 and gave them a ministry in vashti, texas. the lord was always working in wayne's life in directing him to churches that needed a loving and nurturing pastor. through patient application and teaching from god's word, wayne was able to mend broken hearts, to encourage young people to enter the ministry, to win many souls to the lord, and to bind churches together. his love for people endeared him to the many church families and colleges where he ministered throughout the years. the families of vancouver baptist temple in vancouver, washington, the families of grace baptist church in princeton, north carolina, and the families at vashti baptist church in vashti, texas, know firsthand of his love and care for them, a love that was strong to the very end of his earthly ministry. on march 22, 2015, wayne became ill and went to the emergency room in bowie. a ct scan revealed a mass in the pancreas. the doctor expressed urgency that wayne travel to dallas to begin treatment for pancreatic cancer. the final day of wayne's ministry as a shepherd to the people of god was sunday, april 12, 2015. during that sunday morning service, the song ""each step i take"" was sung, and alvonda remembered psalm 37:23 which says ""the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord, and he delighteth in his way. though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for the lord upholdeth him with his hand. i have been young and now am old, yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread. he is ever merciful and lendeth, and his seed is blessed""one of wayne's favorite quotes was this: ""to seek god's will is life's greatest adventure; to find god's will is life's greatest discovery; to do god's will is life's greatest achievement."" wayne james lived a life richly blessed by the lord whom he served, and was always available for his service in ministry. he will be greatly missed by those who loved him. 2015 microsoft terms privacy & cookies developers english (united
