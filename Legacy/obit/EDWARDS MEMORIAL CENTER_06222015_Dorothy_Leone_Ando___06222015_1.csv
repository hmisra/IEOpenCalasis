dorothy leone ando| we all fondly remember our mom, grandma, ""gigi"", sister, and friend as a kind, warm person with an open ear and heart for everyone. we remember her love for birds, all animals, and nature as unique and she leaves that legacy for her kids, grandkids, and great grandkids who wrap their hearts around the same. dorothy (dot or dottie) was born may 7, 1921 in winnipeg, manitoba. she was the first born of 9 (two died shortly after childbirth)... 4 sisters and 1 brother remaining... who called the ""farm"" their home. the small farmhouse had no running water or electric lights... kerosene lanterns were used to do homework and chores. winters were severe. both parents worked hard to make the land productive, growing grain and vegetables for both personal and public use... corn and potatoes would be sacked and taken to the mills; huge barrels of sauerkraut put up in the smoke house; if anything was about to go bad, her mom (evelyn leone) would can it. all the kids had chores, especially helping out in the fields. weeding and picking off potato bugs were two of her least favorite chores. fun activities included walking, running, baseball (at school) and dancing. reading books was her favorite, especially robinson caruso. having few books available, she read and re-read the same. she also cultivated an interest in sketching, and thought she might be an artist someday. during the depression, weather was so dry the farm experienced multiple crop failures. raising chickens became their livelihood for quite some time as did curing ham and making sausages for market. her mom also obtained bees and sold honey as a way of making ends meet. the closest town was 5-6 miles away... the horses would be harnessed and they would ride in the wagon to market, sharing the dirt roads with model t fords. mom moved down to the states to seattle in 1938 and lived with an aunt and uncle while adjusting to electric lights and indoor plumbing! she began working on her us citizenship while going to cosmetology school, desiring to set up her own shop at some time in the future. she also had her sights set on driving ambulances during wwii! she ended up eventually managing a salon in seattle for nine years. she bought her first car for $700... a model a, became a citizen in 1946 and met art ando in 1949 (currently working for a meat packing company), while he was taking classes at the university of washington. their first date was a uw football game! during wwii, art achieved the navy's highest enlisted rank, chief petty officer on the aircraft carrier, uss independence, and earned 9 bronze and 2 silver medals during the many battles fought in the pacific arena. dorothy and art married in 1950, moved to the tacoma area and stated a family while art accepted a civilian logistics position with mc. cord air force base. they had 4 children: norm, linda, bonnie and al, all born in less than 5 years! she devoted herself to raising 4 very rambunctious kids, being actively involved in pta, encouraging each in their area of interest, and earning the golden acorn award for her countless volunteer hours. she was a cub scout and campfire leader and had her part time business of cutting and styling hair for men and women in the community, keeping her skills current. after the kids were raised, dorothy returned to college and obtained her associates degree in arts and science, she learned to swim just short of lifesaving, (even snorkeling in hawaii while in her late 80s.) dot and art raised raspberries... lots of raspberries, and shared them with everyone, they moved from parkland to steilacoom in 2000, and never skipped a beat. she and art loved going to the puget sound parks, collecting drift wood and rocks; working in their beautiful flower and vegetable gardens, going to the mountains, teaching us all of the beauty and majesty of creation. after art passed, dorothy continued to do all of these things with her children, grandchildren, siblings and friends. mom looked forward to her trips to idaho. she would winter in the snow with norm and his family and enjoy long walks in the crisp cold beauty, in the summer, she would go river rafting with them and be completely amazed. dorothy was a bird enthusiast, a member of the audubon society, and supporter of their cause. she enjoyed driving up to british columbia to visit her sisters who also shared her love of nature and all it has to give. she enjoyed a good wedding, and there certainly have been plenty! the music and dancing would always get her on her feet and all the food and decorations kept her busy along with everyone. she was so happy to have grandchildren, spent many hours teaching them about the wonders of the world right in the back yard, loving and encouraging them in their journeys and dreams. she shared in their successes and disappointments, and gave them unconditional love. the great grandbabies loved to follow gi. gi around as she was only 4'8"" inches tall and able to really connect with them on so many levels!! dorothy's smile, daily kindness and giving nature is truly missed. dorothy is survived by her children, norm ando, his wife marie of salmon, idaho; linda swanson of carrollton, texas; bonnie tinsley, her husband mark of steilacoom, washington; and al ando, his wife mary of black diamond, washington. she has 12 surviving grandchildren and 16 great grandchildren. and now the next journey: dancing and enjoying jesus face to face!!
