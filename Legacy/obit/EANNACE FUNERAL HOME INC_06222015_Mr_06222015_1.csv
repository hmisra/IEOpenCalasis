mr. francis paul daniels| mr. francis paul daniels, retired ufd, age 85, passed away peacefully on friday, june 19, 2015 at the masonic care community of ny surrounded by his loving family. born in utica on april 4, 1930, francis was the son of the late daniel and mary (torchia) daniels. he was a graduate of t. r. proctor high school. on august 26, 1950 he married the former frances coriale with whom he shared 64 years filled with laughter and many wonderful memorable moments. their union was that of their era and during the latter parts of their lives they were cared for by their family. they most recently resided at the masonic care community together. francis strived for success in his profession as a firefighter with the utica fire department which began in 1953, protecting and serving his community for 33 years. he was promoted to lieutenant and chief inspector, and in 1972 assumed command of the fire prevention bureau until his retirement in 1986. he truly held in his heart a brotherhood with those he served, and this was a paramount and meaningful time in his life. when not attending to his firefighting duties, he had also been an employee of the caruso cheese company where he worked alongside his late brother-in-law, mike caruso. he then ventured into his own business as founder of f&p distributors providing wholesale italian products to fine restaurants and pizzerias within the utica, rome, and mohawk valley. continuing to be industrious, he helped his grandson eddie behind the counter of little italy imports, where they made many memories together. paul helped people find a reason to smile; some of that came from his god given gift to socialize and his fun loving, witty personality. he will be remembered for his genuine, outgoing ability to connect with everyone. as a member of the daniels family, he had the innate ability to have a culinary flair that not only was seen at his own home, and among his family, but was evident at the fire house where he was always in charge of the kitchen. his love for cooking often reminded him of his own familys knowledge of how to create italian delicacies. paul proved time and again that his hard work ethic provided for the well being of his wife and children, and these personal traits are apparent in the success of the legacy he leaves. he spent everyday enjoying simple activities like tinkering around, and mowing the lawn. when his house was full and his family was together you couldnt find a happier man. on a social level, he enjoyed playing a friendly hand of cards with his buddies, handicapping the horse races at vernon downs, and being a member of the idiot club. he spent many sunday mornings delivering loaves of bread and visiting with family and friends, earning him the title of the bread man. all in all, he proclaimed his love for his family and was very grateful for the respect and dedication they showed him. francis is survived by his wife, fran;
