"share on x jg john gosselink. jun 20 at 3:43 pm clyde was one of those friends that was always there. in years past we fished together on lake conroe and out on the water he was as at home as any man could be. we always got to laugh a lot, tell some really good jokes and catch lots of fish. clyde always checked on me if there was a problem and was a huge loving support when my wife nancy died. real friends are there and don't really have to say much. clyde was a real friend and i will miss him. i know he suffered a lot the last few years of his life and his suffering is over as he now has gone home to be with the lord! praise god! john gosselink. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x jun 20 at 3:37 pm beautiful in blue was purchased for the family of clyde miller. share on x lb laura breitenstein. jun 20 at 2:32 pm madonna and family, i just want you to know how very sorry i am to hear of clyde's passing. as you say my sweet friend, he is an angel now and will be forever watching over you. sending much love and prayers for all of you. laura b. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x jun 19 at 6:00 pm strength & solace spray was purchased for the family of clyde miller. share on x jun 19 at 4:25 pm pink tribute spray was purchased for the family of clyde miller. share on x vn vickie & terry nation. jun 19 at 3:12 pm vickie & terry nation purchased the crystal cross bouquet for the family of clyde miller. share on x jun 19 at 2:50 pm blooming garden basket was purchased for the family of clyde miller. share on x more memories... visitation. jun 20. 4:00 pm - 6:00 pm sam houston memorial funeral home - willis10129 fm 1097 wwillis, tx, us, 77318. get missed the service? send flowers or gifts to the family's home. funeral servicesjun 21. 2:00 pm sam houston memorial funeral home - willis10129 fm 1097 wwillis, tx, us, 77318. get order flowers now for clyde's funeral services wall 365 days of grief support. subscribe sam houston memorial funeral home website designed by funeralone contact obituaries about store
