"share on x bm brenda madison. jun 21 at 5:17 am i met carolyn at rosebower 31 years ago when both of us were in the choir. she had a beautiful alto voice, and we actually did one trio years ago with christel weber. when it became too painful for carolyn to stand in the choir loft, i could still enjoy her singing since she always sat right behind us in the pews. carolyn never liked reading until after she retired. then she became a regular visitor to the church library, and would jokingly compete with other patrons to be the first to check out new books by her favorite authors. i loved her kind heart and how she encouraged everyone. i will truly miss her hugs and her, ""you have a good week"" as we ended each church service. what an amazing week and eternity she has begun in the very presence of our lord. until we meet again, sweet friend. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x pp patricia powelljun 20 at 11:55 am lit a candle in memory of carolyn (culp) sturges. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x more memories... graveside service. jun 22. 2:00 pm provine cemetery. briensburg, ky, usget order flowers now for carolyn's graveside service wall facebook twitter hughes funeral home website designed by funeralone contact obituaries about store
