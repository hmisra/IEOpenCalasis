"share on x bob covey-robbins. jun 11 at 9:23 pm catherine was such a pleasure to work with. one of the best periods of my life was working in usa funds university, and catherine was part of an awesome team. she always made us all look good with her great writing and desktop publishing skills. she was valued then as a co-worker, and continued to be valued as a friend. when we all worked together kochie richardson-vaughn and john pappas started a nickname thing: kochie koo, johnny poo. catherine was katie cool. how fitting!! thanks for being such a wonderful person in my life, catherine! comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x rb ronee baracani. jun 11 at 8:53 pm when i remember catherine the things that flow through my mind are as follows: 1) who the heck is harry chapin? because of catherine i now know, in detail, and always think of her when i hear a chapin song. 2) catherine confirmed my initial belief that red wing fans are crazy and insanely dedicated. although she rooted for the wrong team, it always made hockey season fun and competitive. it was great having someone to join us at ice games. 3) a questionable state, but she was steadfast and loyal to michigan (maybe to a fault) and her alma mater. i always enjoyed poking fun - faygo comes to mind. 4) holidays. i loved having catherine and wade over for thanksgiving or new years. it was great to have company and a great person to share a holiday with when our families were far away. we always had great times playing games and sharing stories (usually involving her best friend dana and the crazy times they shared - moonshine comes to mind). she had such a fun personality and was easy to be around. 5) social events, usually yelp related. as a group with wade and john or others, or just catherine and myself (like the day wade and johnny went to see weird al), we would try out new places in indy or go to places we loved. always a great time because of catherine. she always had something to say, an opinion on something, and was great to have a conversation with. 6) i also think back and am grateful to have played a special part of catherine and wade's secret special day. i always remember how catherine ordered and wore the pippa bow in her hair. there are so many things to add to a list like this, but overall she was always a lively and fun person that we wanted to be around. i could always figure to have a great time with her. i'm grateful i was able to know her and be counted amongst one of her many friends. i will certainly never forget her. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x ml mary losson. jun 11 at 8:50 pm i have been trying to find the words to write something meaningful, someway to express what catherine meant to me. i am not the amazing writer that catherine was. she has corrected my grammar more times than i can remember. it's only been a few days and i miss her terribly. she was nightly facebook confident. we talked about everything and nothing almost every night. i will continue to talk to her and tell her my funny stories and hope that in time i will see her again. my love and prayers go to wade, dana, and all her family and friends that loved her so much. she was so much more amazing than she ever gave herself credit for. sweet dreams catherine. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x mn melanie notestine-draper. jun 11 at 8:38 pm catherine (cathy) and i met in kindergarten. she was an amazing friend. such a giving and loving person. she had an amazing way with words. something i never had and we laughed about it many times. i've never met anyone else like you. if someone needed something you were there. while it is hard to put it words how i feel, which i'm sure you know, i will never forget you. you are beautiful inside and out. cathy i will miss you. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x jennifer sherman. jun 11 at 6:05 pm catherine was one of the most dynamic, vibrant and sensitive women i knew. i had the honor of being her friend since 9th grade. i wouldn't call her just a friend but a sister. she had a passion for life tackled with that wicked sense of humor. she marked this life for 40 years but her impact will live on. my heart goes out to wade and their family. cathy you will be missed and forever in my heart. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x rc rebecca cooper. jun 11 at 3:37 pm catherine was one of the funniest, loveliest, most sensitive people i have ever met online (and that is saying a lot since it's my job to meet people online). i met her through dana reimer and she helped beta test a game i worked on, and we got to know each other that way. i won't forget how she made me laugh, often, and our joke about bruce springsteen that somehow never got old. she will be so, so missed. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x ys yvonne souverein. jun 11 at 3:07 pm catherine was one of the many people i met trough blogging. i met her in person in 2009 and she was, hands down, one of the loveliest nicest people i ever met. she will be incredibly missed within our community <3. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x dana reimer. jun 11 at 1:58 pm 2 files added to the album new album name comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x more memories... service. jun 13. 2:00 pm roberts park united methodist church 401 n. delaware street. indianapolis, in, us, 46202. get new album name 365 days of grief support. subscribe facebook carlisle-branson funeral service & crematory website designed by funeralone contact obituaries about
