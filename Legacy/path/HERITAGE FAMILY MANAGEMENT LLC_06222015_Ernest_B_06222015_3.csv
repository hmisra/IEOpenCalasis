"share on x bg betty brown and wp godsey. jun 20 at 7:30 pm becky, mark, debbie, michelle, christopher, and will, please accept our condolences for the loss of your precious husband, father, step-father and grandfather. our hearts are broken for you. eb was a quiet, gentle man who worked hard to provide for his family. he never raised his voice in anger as long as we knew him and he was so gracious when i would stop by the house to sing with ""the voices"" or to go somewhere with becky. when we had our family reunion in may 2012, not only did he and becky provide most of the necessities for a successful meal, they also stayed long after everyone else left to clean the fellowship hall of the church and help me get the trash out. he treated me so kindly anytime i saw him at the credit union and went out of his way to help me with anything i needed, or even just to say hello and ask about dad, eddy and the rest of the family. i could go on and on with stories, but i know you have a lifetime of memories of your own. dad is in health south recuperating from vertigo and bronchitis and i will need to be with him monday and tuesday. when he gets home, maybe i can drop in for awhile and listen while you talk, cry, and laugh at all the special memories of this sweet and precious man. love and prayers, betty and uncle wpcomment share comment share facebook twitter share on x jk judy rhea kistner. jun 20 at 5:37 pm to the family of e. b., it is a loss... deeply felt. please accept my sincere condolence and with that the wonderful memories may sustain you in this difficult time. heaven is a brighter place today. well done good and faithful servant, well done ! sincerely, judy rhea (kistner)ketron classmate, 1962. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x more memories... visitation. jun 22. 5:00 pm - 7:00 pm living word lutheran church5210 north roan street. gray, tn, usget order flowers now for ernest's visitation celebration of life service. jun 22. 7:00 pm living word lutheran church5210 north roan street. gray, tn, us, 37615. get order flowers now for ernest's celebration of life service committal service. jun 23. 10:00 am mountain home national cemetery. mountain home, tn, usget order flowers now for ernest's committal service wall 365 days of grief support. subscribe heritage family management, llc website designed by funeralone contact obituaries about store
