"share on x kd karen dalejun 14 at 5:55 pm one night long ago living on the farm with virginia, i was out after dark. i looked at the giant christmas tree and it was full of fireflies. i got virginia and we watched them light up the tree just like christmas. the night tom left us, i was outside and the fireflies were lighting up the trees! i believe virginia was telling me don't worry, tom is here with us and he is happy, shining his light brightly. yes, that's what i believe. shine on tom hixson! love. karen dalecomment share comment share facebook twitter share on x hi henry n achey iiijun 13 at 8:38 pm i worked with tommy when i was an apprentice back in 1992, my thoughts and preayers are with all of you. henry achey iiicomment share comment share facebook twitter share on x more memories... currently no events are scheduled. wall 365 days of grief support. subscribe hamilton funeral home and cremation services website designed by funeralone contact obituaries about store
