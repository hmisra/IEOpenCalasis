"share on x ba belinda aderhold. jun 14 at 1:17 pm i have so many memories of barbara. when i first became food service director at smoke rise, i really didn't know what to expect. barbara took me under her wing. on several occasions i would come in on saturday evening and work late in the night preparing for an after church dinner on sunday. it was nothing to look up and see mrs. barbara parking her car to come and help. she would stay with me until i finished. she always brought laughter to the kitchen and gave me advice about catering and food preparation. there were very few teas, if any, that she wasn't there showing her support of the happy occasion. i loved for her to go to food shows with me. on one such trip, we were talking and i turned to look at her and she was gone. i looked down and she had fallen. i begged her to let me take her to the doctor, but as you know, she was a little stubborn. she did finally agree to let the ""bike medics"" checked her out but refused to leave without going to the food show. we walked all over the bjcc food show but i didn't find out until the next day, when she wasn't able to come to church, that her face was bruised and she had broken her cheek. on one mission trip, she rode with greg and me and our suburban broke down. there wasn't enough room in the tow truck for all of us, so mrs. barbara sat in greg's lap to the garage. i know she loved and was proud of her family by the way she talked about them so often. i know she loved jesus just by the way she lived and her godly advice. she did a lot for smoke rise church and our community. she will be missed by many and i can truly say, i was blessed and am a better person because i knew her. i loved mrs. barbara and i will miss her. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x more memories... currently no events are scheduled. no medias to show. the new gardendale funeral home website designed by funeralone contact obituaries about store
