"share on x mi mindy. jun 21 at 10:05 am as neighbors for a short time, it didn't take long to establish a friendship with robert and his wife. for the most, part we didn't realize i had worked and knew his family. i will keep picking those berries behind the fence robert! i will miss that smile walking into bp. may you rest in peace. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x ja janet. jun 20 at 10:59 pm it seems growing up it was always a duo of ""bob 'n marilyn"" coming to visit marilyn's aunt (my mom)- seems a few yrs later my mom would hold her future in-laws to the almost unattainable standard of bobness. then came along the cutest little girl cousin i knew, so i named my little dolly ""jackie"" after her. then came the boys, as cute as their sister and parents. the picture of bob on his page is the same smile he would have anytime he said hello, no matter what age i was, he emitted a genuine kindness along with his hulk hogan body, that made me marvel- cause none of my friends dads looked like that or were so cheerful. bob and his metal detector gained hero status in our big family, when he found my brother-in-laws wedding ring many years after it was lost, in my parents backyard. and we marveled as to his loving devotion to his wife, bringing her to so many of our family's seemingly endless events. he even came to my son's wedding with marilyn, and tenderly brought his frail wheelchair bound mother-in-law (my belated mom's sister- known as ""auntie"" to all us kids.) auntie told me on that day that bob was her ""favorite nurse"" and took amazing care of her, and he did so until she died. thank you bob. but the best story was this spring- a happenstance visit i made to bob n marilyn's, when my 10 yr old great-nephew and his 12 yr old sister needed emergent potty stop on hwy 10. i realized it was daylight for once as drove to amhurst exit, so called marilyn from gas station to see if up for a quick hello visit. of course it was hugs and love coming in, and then they broke me the news of the cancer, but he was on the mend. my 10 yr old nephew vowed to have ultimate collections like his ""cousin bob"", as bob explained them to him- mikey was in awe of him. marilyn explained how related, and she grew up with their gramma, and knew them when their gramma (my sister) was alive. more hugs and love as we said good byes. when we drove away, mikey said in his very serious tone ""wow! this was a great day!"" and i asked why - ""i met some relatives i didn't know, and they even love me!"" thank you bob 'n marilyn for making his day, his year, and probably his life. my guess is mikey is not alone in how he felt, and you probably have touched many more lives with your love than you will ever know. may god bless and keep you all in his tender loving care, so that we will all have eternity to share... with bob :)comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x sk steve korger. jun 20 at 8:59 pm thank god for sharing robert miller with us all these glorious years together! marilyn you and bob were the flynn and korger families pride and joy and you'll always be remembered with a joyful smile! your children, spouses and grandchildren will forever be comforted knowing bob and marilyn were and always will be there for them! love, steve korger. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x la lynn marie archibald-smith. jun 20 at 5:11 pm we share in the sorrow you are experiencing at this most difficult time. i'm grateful to have had uncle bob as a part of my life. find solace in the memories of him you were a part of, and in the pictures of those memories. they soften the hard to get through days. find comfort in letting him go, no longer in pain and suffering, and knowing he is now reunited with his siblings and parents. love, lynn marie. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x la lynn marie archibald-smith. jun 20 at 4:46 pm lit a candle in memory of robert miller. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x mary thompson. jun 20 at 4:28 pm bob was always so friendly, he always gave me such nice big hugs when ever we would meet. will miss those and him always. mary thompson. comment share comment share facebook twitter share on x more memories... memorial visitation. jun 26. 10:00 am - 11:00 am st. mary magdalene catholic churchn2845 shadow road. waupaca, wi, us, 54981. get order flowers now for robert's memorial visitation memorial mass. jun 26. 11:00 am st. mary magdalene catholic churchn2845 shadow road. waupaca, wi, us, 54981. get order flowers now for robert's memorial mass wall 365 days of grief support. subscribe holly funeral home website designed by funeralone contact obituaries about store
