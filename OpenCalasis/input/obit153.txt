Ken enlisted in the Marines in 1937 at the Marine Corps Recruiting Depot in Los Angeles, California.  He retired from the Marine Corps in 1959 as a Warrant Officer 4.  He served in the South Pacific during World War II and during the Korean Conflict.  
On July 6, 1943, he was united in marriage to LaVeeda Dugan.  To this union three children were born, Ken Myers, Jr., Patti Kilbourne, and Pam Myers.  
He was an avid gardener and wherever they lived he spent hours in his vegetable garden, whistling while he worked.  While living in the Pacific Northwest, he loved to go hunting and fishing.  In the earlier years he belonged to a flying club and earned his private pilots license for land and sea.  
Some of his talents included building projects, woodworking, cooking and even baking.  He learned to bake as a high school student in the 1930s by working in the bakery at Dacoma.  His baking talent was put to use in a CCC camp in Grand Junction, Colorado in 1936, and aboard the Lexington Aircraft Carrier out of San Diego Harbor in the early 1940s.  In the 1950s he created his own sweet and spicy BBQ sauce recipe which his family continues to use to this day.  
Ken became a Christian as a teenager in the early 1930s under the preaching of his grandfather, Pastor Joe Keith, at the Dacoma United Brethren Church.  
The Myers lived in Washington State from 1946 to 1986 when they moved to Alva.  Ken worked for a time in the Maintenance Department at NWOSU.
