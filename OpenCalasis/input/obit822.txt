Gilbert attended school at Enterprise School at Lookout, Oklahoma, through the 8th grade, then transferred to Freedom High School.  After he graduated from high school he worked on the family farm until he married.  He met Lois Maxwell of Selman and they were married February 24, 1946, in Lookout.  Gilbertâ€™s brother, Leonard Carlson, performed the ceremony.  	    
Gilbert and Lois lived in the Lookout and Freedom communities during their married life.  One son, Denis Leroy Carlson, was born to this marriage.  He worked for Ralph Klepinger and Melvin Patterson doing cattle work and farming.  Later, Gilbert rented grass and farm land where he milked cows, raised chickens and pigs to take care of his family.  He had his own horse so he helped surrounding ranchers work their cattle.  He loved being a cowboy, cutting wheat, and baleing hay for himself and his neighbors.  	    
Gilbert and his son, Denis, started farming and ranching together in 1972.  Denis and Sara and their children took over the farming and ranching in 1995.  Then Gilbert spent his retirement working for Rural Water District until 2008 when he retired after 30 years of service due to ill health.   They later moved to Alva due to illness and necessity of medical care.
