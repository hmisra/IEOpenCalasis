Harry Buford Meyer, son of the late Alvin Arthur and Anna (Ramseyer) Meyer, was born August 2, 1914, on the family farm in Alfalfa County, Oklahoma, and passed away at Integris Baptist Hospital in Enid, Oklahoma, at the age of 93 years, 6 months, and 29 days.  
Harry was raised on a farm northeast of Burlington, Oklahoma and graduated from Burlington High School.  Harry worked on the family farm, helped with wheat harvests, at times following the crews north.  He worked in his brother?s drugstore for a time.  
He lived for a number of years in Alva where he enjoyed the Senior Citizens there.  For a number of years he has been cared for by the Wakita Health Center and was there until the time of his death.  The entire staff there is an efficient, professional and caring group.  We would like to name Lester Corr an honorary Pall Bearer.
