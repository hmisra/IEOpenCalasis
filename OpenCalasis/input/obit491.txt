On September 27, 1982, Jerry and Connie Garrison made a long awaited trip to Enid for the birth of Grant Schaefer Garrison.  On Tuesday, February 26 2008, Grant was unexpectedly called home.  He was 25 years, 4 months, and 30 days old.  
Grant was an inquisitive, happy boy who asked lots of questions and wanted to be right where the action was all the time.  He had a contagious smile and his laugh let those around him know of his presence.   
Grant wasn?t always "excited? about school, but after graduation from Alva High he attended Northwest Technology Center.  He worked for awhile at Plane Plastics.  
He was preceded in death by his maternal grandfather, Harold Kamas, and his paternal grandparents, Geral and Velma Garrison.
