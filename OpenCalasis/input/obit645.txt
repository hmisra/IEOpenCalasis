Jean Wesner Cox, the youngest daughter of Maud and Charles Wesner, was born September 21, 1922 and passed from this life July 30, 2013.    
Jean attended Alva schools and graduated from Horace Mann in 1939.  On December 15, 1940 Jean was united in marriage with Fred Cox, Jr.  To this union were born 3 sons, James, David and Larry, and a daughter, Barbara.     
In 1955 Jean began her studies in Library Science at NWOSU.  Her passion for libraries was also her vocation.  Jean worked at the Alva Public library for 5 years before moving to Denver where she worked in the Jefferson County Library system for 11 years. Retiring from Jefferson County in 1986, Jean returned to Alva and once again took up the position of librarian in the Alva Library.    
An avid reader, Jean also enjoyed gardening, sewing and her family.  Computer scrabble, emailing family and friends and books were sources of enjoyment for her in her latter years.    
Jean was preceded in death by her husband Fred, her sister Helen Weigand, and two grandsons Kenneth and Brandon.  She is survived by her sons, her daughter, eight grandsons, two granddaughters, numerous great grandchildren, and her sister Sylvia Love.    
By her request Jean was cremated and no services will be held.    
Memorial donations are welcome to the Alva Public Library in care of Marshall Funeral Home.
