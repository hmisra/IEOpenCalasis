Karmen (Rush) Gulliford, loving mother and grandmother, passed away May 3, 2007 at Integris Bass Hospital, Enid, OK, after a long illness. Born May 21, 1939 in Lindsborg, KS, she was the daughter of Laurn "Cotton" and Edna (Johnson) Rush.  
She is preceded in death by her father and mother, Laurn and Edna, brother, Elmer "Duke" Rush, and great grandson, Andrew Henry.  
She is survived by her children Leslie Henry and her husband, Ronnie, of Amarillo, TX, Galen Hulse and his wife, Deanna, of Great Bend, KS, Hollie Cunningham and her husband, Dennis, of Waynoka, OK, Sascha Bailey of Oologah, OK, and Trenton Gulliford, and his wife, Autumn, of Waynoka, OK; 13 grandchildren; 8 great grandchildren; one brother, Shenny Rush of Wichita, KS; one sister-in-law, Diane Samms Rush of Wichita, Kansas; and many special friends.  
Karmen never met a stranger. They were all friends.  She was an avid bowler until her health made it impossible to continue. She loved to play cards, crochet, and watch her grandchildren participate in athletics, school functions, and grow from birth to high school graduation. These things brought her great pride and joy.  
Even as her health deteriorated and her participation in family functions became more limited, she made sure everyone had their favorite dish as well as her famous Peanut Brittle, Chocolate No-Bake Cookies, and Bierox, which everyone ranted and raved about.  
Karmen will be greatly missed and always loved.  
Memorial contributions may be made through the funeral home to the Waynoka All Sports Club.
