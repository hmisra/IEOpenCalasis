A memorial service for Larry Don "LD" White will be 1:00 p.m. Saturday , August 27, 2011, at the Marshall Funeral Home Chapel under the direction of Marshall Funeral Home of Alva.  
Larry Don White, son of the late Otto Leland and Dorothy (Hageman) White, was born September 4, 1960, in Abilene, Texas, and lost his battle with lung cancer on August 21, 2011.  
Larry grew up in Abilene with his sister, Dorothy Lea.  He attended the Abilene Public School through the 11th grade.  At the age of 17, Larry moved to Alva, Oklahoma.  It was at that time he went to work painting for his step-father, Gilbert Fisher, and brother, Harry.  Larry quickly discovered his talent and life long occupation as a skilled painter.  
Larry frequently moved between Abilene and Alva during the 1980&amp;s and the early &amp;90&amp;s.  He returned to Oklahoma permanently in 1995.  
Larry?s pride and joy was his family, especially his daughters, Louree Dawn and Charity Faith.  He was particularly proud of his grandchildren, Avery Mae and Kallen Brian.  
Larry was an avid fisherman and could often be found at a local fishing hole with his companion "Big ?Un," his dog, in tow.  Larry had a green thumb and enjoyed gardening during the summer months and tending to his numerous house plants and cacti year round.  
Larry was preceded in death by his parents, Dorothy and Lee White.  
He is survived by two daughters, Louree White and Jacob Gordon of Jet  and Charity Digby and husband, Dennis of Enid; two sisters, Jane Gaskill of Alva and Dorothy Deen and husband, Trey, of Merkel, Texas; two brothers Dean Fisher and wife, Louise, of Woodward and Harry Fisher of Alva.
