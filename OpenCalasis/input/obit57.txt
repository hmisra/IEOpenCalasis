Ricky graduated from Waynoka High School.  He then attended Oklahoma State University at Oklahoma City and had almost completed his Law Enforcement degree.  On March 12, 1994, he was united in marriage to Michelle DeAnn Hougland at Alva.  They lived in Alva where he worked as an Alva Police Officer, and then to Perry where he worked for the Perry Police Department and Noble County Sheriff?s department.  In 2001, they moved to their home southeast of Waynoka where he worked for the Woods County Sheriff&amp;s Department, then later at the Little Sahara State Park.  He was a welder by trade, but his heart was in law enforcement.
