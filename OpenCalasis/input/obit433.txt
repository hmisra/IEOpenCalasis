Graveside services for Leota Beulah Fulton, 97, will be 10:00 a.m. on Monday, September 16, 2013,  at Alva Municipal Cemetery.  Interment is under the direction of Marshall Funeral Home of Alva.    
Leota Beulah Fulton passed away on Wednesday, September 11th in Alva, Oklahoma. She was born on February 5, 1916, to Alvia and Beulah Moreland of Freedom, Oklahoma.     
In 1935, she married the love of her life, Mart Fulton. The couple had one daughter, Marietta Jean (Fulton) Graham, born August 20, 1936. For the next 58 years, the two were rarely apart, making their living farming and ranching near Freedom. Many will remember seeing them late in life, holding hands as they walked together at places like the Freedom Rodeo or the Old Cowhand's Reunion.    
Since 2011, the staff at Beadles Nursing Home has cared for Leota, and the family wishes to extend their sincere gratitude for their care and compassion.     
Leota is preceded in death by her father, Alvia (1967), her mother, Beulah (1990), and her beloved husband, Mart, who passed away on October 3, 1993.     
Leota is survived by her daughter Marietta Jean Graham of El Paso, Texas, her grandson Roger J. Graham of Tahlequah, Oklahoma (the Cherokee Nation), and her granddaughter and grandson-in-law Ron &amp; Jodi Gillett also of El Paso, Texas, as well as several cousins.    
Northwest Oklahoma was the only place the Fulton's loved to call home. Leota mourned Mart's passing for almost 20 years. Now, as it should be, they're together again, walking and holding hands.    
Leota's family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to Beadles Nursing Home in Alva or the Old Cowhand's Association in Freedom.
