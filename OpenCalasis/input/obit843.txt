Funeral services for Nolan James Hurst will be 2:00 p.m. Monday, December 10, 2012, at the Alva First Baptist Church with Pastor Mark McDonald officiating.  Interment will be in the Alva Municipal Cemetery under the direction of Marshall Funeral Home of Alva.    
Nolan James Hurst, son of James Ernest and Cherie Elise (Fisher) Hurst, came into this world on December 11, 2008, at Enid, Oklahoma, and left to run and play in Heaven on December 5, 2012, just five days before his 4th birthday.    
Nolan’s life was short, but he brought great joy and touched many lives while here.  Nolan was a fighter and did not let frequent illness stop him from living his life to the fullest.  Nolan loved music and had an infectious giggle.  He attended Head Start and he loved being around other children.  His favorite animal was a shark and he thought this word was funny.  He loved to play with his younger brother, Gage, to have his sister, Abigail, sing to him, and his sister, Alaina, hold him.  He was the light of his parent’s life.      
Nolan was preceded in death by his grandmother, Linda Hicks; and his great grandparents, Ray and Jean Gourley, Gilbert Fisher, Dorothy White and Jim Hurst.    
Nolan is survived by his loving parents, Jim and Cherie Hurst of Alva; sisters, Alaina and Abigail, and brother, Gage, all of the home; his maternal  grandparents, Franklin and Cheryl Murrow of Alva and Harry Fisher of Alva; paternal grandparents, James and Hope Hurst of Woodward; his great grandmother, Phyllis Fisher of Alva; a particularly special aunt, Chenae Felton of Alva; and numerous other family and friends that will miss him greatly.    
In lieu of flowers, a love fund has been set up at BancCentral in Nolan’s name to help defray final expenses.
