Margaret Lenora Prewett Davis, daughter of the late C.H. and Golda Prewett, was born April 7th, 1941, in Omaha, Nebraska.  She passed away April 21, 2009 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, shortly after her 68th birthday.  She led a spirited and varied life as a mother, friend, artist, speech therapist and teacher.   
Margaret grew up in Omaha, where she attended Benson High School.  During the time the family lived in Omaha, they spent their summers farming and ranching near Fargo and Burlington, Oklahoma.   After leaving Omaha, she went on to get degrees in Speech Pathology, Fine Arts, and Early Childhood Education.  Her interests took her in many directions, working with court-referred adolescents in Detroit,  traveling to Bolivia visiting with Wycliffe Bible Translators, creating etchings, sculpture, and prints as a professional artist, and teaching language and reading both as a private tutor and in the public schools.  
She was married in 1973 to Wendell Alan Davis, and had three children, Brent, Nathan, and Janelle.  She spent the last three years in Albuquerque, enjoying beautiful mountain sunsets and making a new friend a day at the local Starbucks.  She was a member of Desert Springs Church in Albuquerque, where she was dearly loved.  
Margaret is survived by her husband, Alan; their three children, Brent and wife, Kimberly, Nathan, and Janelle; her brothers Omer and wife Joanne, Roger and wife Judy, and her sister, Linda.  
Memorial contributions may be made through the funeral home to Wycliffe Bible Translators or Gospel for Asia.
