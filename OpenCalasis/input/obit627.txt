Graveside services for Eva May Collie, 97, will be held at the Alva Cemetery 2:00 p.m. Saturday, February 2. 2013 with Pastor John Smith officiating.  Interment is under the direction of Marshall Funeral Home of Alva.    
Eva Fish Collie was born to William and Flora Scott Fish on August 26, 1915 in the Winchester Community 20 miles northwest of Alva, and went to be with her Lord on January 31, 2013 in Wichita, Kansas.     
All through her life, her love for the Lord has been shown through the care and concern she has shown for her family and others.  Her faithful service to the church manifested itself through the missionary society and serving funeral dinners, to checking on and taking food to neighbors and friends.  She has most of all shown love to her family by being there whenever and wherever help was needed or just to lend a listening ear.    
She was preceded in death by her husband Orville James Collie who was killed in a pipeline accident near Buffalo, OK on December 16, 1943.   Also preceding her in death were her parents William and Flora Fish, her brother Lyle, and her sister and her husband Geneva and Harold Munger.    
She is survived by her daughter, Sharon and her husband Lee Smith of Wichita; 2 grandchildren and their spouses Richard and (Melissa) Smith of Coppell, TX, and Shari and (John) Gerlach of Wichita; 5 great-grandchildren and their spouses Emily, Matt, and Philip Smith, James and (Krista) Gerlach, Amanda and (Daniel) Chaney; one great-great-granddaughter Isabelle Chaney; a sister-in-law Ruth Fish of McMinnville, OR; a brother-in-law and his wife Arlo and Mary Collie of Alva; and numerous nieces and nephews.    
In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made through the funeral home to the Alva Wesleyan Church.
