Bryon D. Yadon, son of Bobby Dale Yadon and the late Beverly Ann (Reed) Yadon, was born September 6, 1959, in Hutchinson, Kansas, and passed away October 1, 2014, at Waynoka, Oklahoma, at the age of 55 years and 25 days.    
Bryon was the second of 4 children. He love to work with his hands and fix things and he enjoyed sightseeing.   In 1978 he graduated from Waynoka High School and was a proud member of the 1976 State Championship Football team.  After graduation, he started working for the Santa Fe Railroad as a trackman and later in his life he worked for Hanor Pig Farm.  He also served proudly with the Oklahoma National Guard.      Bryon is survived by his father, Bob, of Waynoka; one brother, Bob Yadon, Jr. and  Cheryl, of Bonham, Texas; two sisters, Brenda Beck and husband, Brad, of Waynoka, and Bonnie Smith and husband, Rusty, of Newcastle Oklahoma.  Though Bryon never had children of his own, he was a very proud uncle of Brandi Mendenhall and husband,  Keoni,  Kim Betterton and husband,  Brandon,  Britni Wharton and husband,  Chris, Brandon Yadon and wife, Keyana, Kendra Loftice,  Bryne Beck and wife, Rachel,  Brooke Smith &amp; Michael Seachrist, and Ty Smith.    
As Bryon got older and his health declined, his interest changed.   He enjoyed watching old movies, especially Gilligan's Island, puzzles and visits from his great nieces and nephews. It made his day to hear them laugh as he enjoyed watching them play. He will truly be missed by Breya, Brylee, Briston, and Christopher Wharton, Elizabeth Betterton, Jaylee Beck, Camdyn Yadon, and Kenzlee Seachrist; and other relatives and friends.    
Memorial contributions may be made through the funeral home to the Waynoka EMTs.
