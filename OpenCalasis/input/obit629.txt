Memorial services for Marie Elaine McDonald will be 2:00 p.m. Thursday, March, 12, 2015, at Marshall Funeral Home Chapel.  She was cremated at her request under the direction of Marshall Funeral Home of Alva.  	    
Marie Elaine McDonald, daughter of the late Gaythor Leroy “Buck” and Kathryn Marie (Jacobs) Buckley, was born December 12, 1953, and passed away March 8, 2015, at the age of 61 years, 2 months, and 6 days.  	    
On June 14, 1973, Marie married Wilbert “Tuff” McDonald and they made their home at Whitehorse, seventeen miles west of Alva.  To this marriage a son, Dusty Lee McDonald and a daughter, Sandy Ann McDonald were born.  	    
Marie loved the land, animals, art, books, puzzles, Star Trek, and people.  At all stages of her life she was a caregiver whether it was for her family, her many animals, or the families she helped as a home health care provider.  She loved and valued life.  	    
Her proudest moments were when she became “Grandma” and later ”Ma” (Great Grandma).  She loved each and every one of her grandchildren.  	    
Marie was blessed with Brittany, Brianna, Bailey (she was awaiting her Grandma Rie, in heaven), Blake and Brandt by Sandy and Billy Lee.  Dusty and Lam McDonald blessed her with Mui and Eli McDonald.  	    
She was given the title “Ma” when Brianna made her a great grandma with the arrival of Greyson and Mason and Brittany blessed her with our little diva, Adrianna.  	    
Besides her parents, she was preceded in death by her husband, Tuff.  	    
Marie is survived by her brothers, Leroy Buckley and Lloyd Buckley and wife, Daisy; a sister, Julie Buckley; a number of nieces and nephews; other relatives and countless friends.  	    
Memorial contributions may be made to the funeral home for final expenses or the Alva Public Library.
